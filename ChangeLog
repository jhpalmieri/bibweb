2003-11-25  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* released version 0.60.
	
	* bibweb: found alternative URL to use, which gives bibtex output
	all at once (instead of doing things in two stages the way I have
	been) -- this was in a program by Nevin Kapur (now at Cal Tech?)
	which was similar in functionality to bibweb.  So I'm using that
	URL instead.  This places a limitation on bibweb: it can only
	return 50 matches for any citation, because I think that's how
	many this URL can produce.  I also don't know how to use it to
	retrieve the review (as a dvi, pdf, or postscript file) so I have
	removed those options -- now it just gets bibtex information.

2003-11-24  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* released version 0.50.

	* bibweb: switch from using wget (etc.) to using perl packages,
	thus making the program more "self-contained".

	* bibweb: changed bibtex comment string to "@comment"; added
	bibweb option "-lax".  "bibweb -lax" uses "%" for the comment
	character.  (% is not an official bibtex comment character,
	although it does seem to work.)

	* bibweb: added "-debug" option; "bibweb -debug" prints some
	debugging information (like the URLs being used).

2003-11-19  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* released version 0.49.
	
	* bibweb: the AMS did something to break bibweb again, and I think
	I've fixed it.  In particular: there are now two types of MR
	numbers: the old ones, and new ones which are just 7 digit
	numbers.  bibweb now uses the old ones for printing and uses the
	new ones for searching and constructing URLs.  Also, the AMS
	changed the basic URL for the initial search, and so I've tried to
	fix the one bibweb uses to compensate.
	
2002-11-12  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* released version 0.48.
	
	* bibweb: changed path to perl executable
	
	* bibweb: the AMS did something to break bibweb again, and I think
	I've fixed it.

2002-03-21  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* released version 0.47.
	
	* bibweb: added option '-sep CHAR': use CHAR instead of semicolon
	to separate fields in long citation format.

2000-11-09  John H. Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>
	
	* released version 0.46.

	* bibweb: the AMS did something to break bibweb again, and I think
	I've fixed it.

2000-11-09 Laurent Bartholdi <Laurent.Bartholdi@math.unige.ch>, 
	(modified by John H. Palmieri <palmieri@math.washington.edu>)

	* bibweb: added option '-r': insert the math review in the bibtex output.

2000-02-10  John H. Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* bibweb: specifying publication year wasn't working, so I fixed
	it (by specifying the 'dr' field to be either 'all' or 'pubyear').

1999-09-23  John Palmieri  <palmieri@math.washington.edu>

	* bibweb: released version 0.44.

	* bibweb: changed URLs and stuff so that bibweb works with MathSciNet
	version 5.0.
	
	* bibweb: command line option -pdf retrieves information in pdf format.
	
	* bibweb: new address.

1999-03-02  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.43.

	* bibweb: clarified copyright and licensing information.

1998-10-26  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.41.

1998-10-26  Michael Friendly <friendly@hotspur.psych.yorku.ca>

	* bibweb: added option to look for webget if neither lynx nor wget
	are present.

1998-10-26  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: more modifications related to MathSciNet 4.0.

1998-09-22  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.41.

	* bibweb: changed URLs and stuff so that bibweb works with MathSciNet
	version 4.0.

1998-05-04  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.40.

	* bibweb: added another paragraph about the GNU GPL.

	* COPYING: added this file to the distribution.

1998-04-21  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.39.

	* bibweb: made comment character a variable, in case some weird
	version of BibTeX barfs when it sees `%'.

1998-04-15  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.38.

	* bibweb: fixed a bug: $use_bibtex was not being set by default if
	no other options were chosen.
	
	* bibweb: MathSciNet can now handled getitem requests properly
	with temporary MR numbers.

1998-04-02  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.37.

	* bibweb: I noticed that lynx seems able to return dvi and
	postscript output just fine, so the -d and -p options now work, as
	long as lynx is available.

	* bibweb: Since MathSciNet now can return BibTeX information
	directly using mathscinet-getitem, the URLs are easier once we
	know the MR number.  So $new_wget_url has been redefined.

1998-01-06  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: released version 0.36.

	* bibweb: New feature: bibweb uses the environment variable
	MATHSCINET_SITE for its default MathSciNet search site.  If this
	variable is not defined, then the default is e-math.ams.org.  Of
	course, you can still specify a different site using the
	command-line argument -e.

	* bibweb: released version 0.35.

	* bibweb: New feature: if you give the argument '-e rice', it
	translates that to '-e ams.rice.edu'.  Similarly:
	'ams' is short-hand for 'e-math.ams.org',
	'bielefeld' is shorthand for 'ams.mathematik.uni-bielefeld.de',
	'bonn' is shorthand for 'klymene.mpim-bonn.mpg.de', and
	'strasbg' is shorthand for 'irmasrv1.u-strasbg.fr'

	* bibweb: AMS changed its format, so bibweb wasn't retrieving the
	number of matches.
	
1998-01-06  John Greenlees <j.greenlees@sheffield.ac.uk>

	* bibweb: changed Bielefeld address.  (Well, maybe not.)

1997-12-05  Ralph Freese  <ralph@math.hawaii.edu>

1997-11-25  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: fixed bug: if using Lynx, and when retrieving item with
	temporary MR number, nothing was returned.

1997-11-07  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	* bibweb: fixed bug: if --max=NUM option was used with NUM>9, if
	there were more than 10 matches, only first 9 were returned.

1997-11-05  John H Palmieri  <palmieri@member.ams.org>

	versions, even when there was a unique match, the appropriate key
	would not get assigned to the bibtex entry.

	* bibweb: fixed bug in citation parsing (have to set author, etc,
	to '' for each citation)

	* bibweb: changed version to 0.27
