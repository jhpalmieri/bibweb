These instructions may be a bit out of date.  You should really read
the documentation in bibweb.dvi or bibweb.info or bibweb.texi or
bibweb.html (same documentation, different formats).

-------------------

Before you even think about installing bibweb, you need to make sure
that you can use MathSciNet from your machine.  If not, you're out of
luck.

To install bibweb:

Put bibweb somewhere in your path.  For instance, you might put
it in $HOME/bin, as long as that is in your path (and if it isn't,
look at your .cshrc (or equivalent) file).  Make sure its permissions
are set to "executable" (i.e., do 'chmod ugo+x bibweb').

I think bibweb requires at least version 5.003 of perl.
