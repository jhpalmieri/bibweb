bibweb is a utility for automatically retrieving bibliographical
information from the American Mathematical Society's MathSciNet
program.  John Palmieri ("engineer") wrote bibweb, and Bill Dwyer
("idea man") helped to design it.

If you're too lazy to go to the library or use a web browser to find
out bibliographical information for that ground-breaking paper you're
writing, you can let bibweb do the work for you.  You have to use
bibtex (which means you have to use latex, I think), and you have to
write citations in a particular format, but that's about it.

See the files bibweb.dvi, bibweb.html, bibweb.info, bibweb.texi for
documentation (same documentation, different formats).

See the file 'INSTALL' for old installation instructions.

See the file 'HOW_TO' for old directions on the use of bibweb.

This program is free software, distributed under the GNU General
Public License; see the file 'COPYING' for more information.
